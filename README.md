<p><h1>SHINING FORCE</h1></br>
is my attempt at learning to program the Sega Genesis "Shining Force" game in Python.</p>

<p><h2>Description:</h2></br>
My nephew was learning Python in school, and he asked for my assistance to understand Python. He explained that he'd really like to write a game like "Shining Force." So naturally I had to brush-up on my Python game programming, so I wouldn't lose the highly coveted title as "Worlds Greatest Uncle." I found several good online tutorials that gave me an excellent background in Python games.</br>
I am attempting to create a Python game framework that not only re-creates "Shining Force" but can equally play other games using this framework. I settled on implementing the framework by providing main, level, and asset files. For example: the main file loads each level's gameplay which loads each levels background and character images.</br>
I have developed my "Shining Force" game with Python 3.11. I currently only have the Sega logo, Introduction, and Level 1 map with a moveable animated Max character. I need to create the other characters, their interactions, and the rest of the levels.</p>

<p><b>How to install and run the project:</b></br>
After installing Python, Pygame, and Pytmx:</br>
cd to your development directory.</br>
<code>cd /path/to/development</code></br>
download git files</br>
<code>git clone https://gitHub.com/jtferro3/shining-force.git</code></br>
<code>cd /path/to/shining-force</code></br>
<code>python3 main.py</code></br>
